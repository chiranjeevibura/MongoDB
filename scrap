If you must have the empty string but MongoDB doesnâ€™t accept it, you could introduce a preprocessing step to handle empty strings in a special way before writing to MongoDB. For example, treat empty strings as a special flag or replace them with a string MongoDB will accept (like a single space or a placeholder) and handle that in your application logic.

Summary:
If lit("").cast(StringType()) causes issues with MongoDB, use a single space (" ") as a fallback.
Empty strings may cause problems when MongoDB tries to convert them into BSON, but single spaces are usually safe.
For now, try using a single space (" ") as the placeholder if empty strings are not working.
